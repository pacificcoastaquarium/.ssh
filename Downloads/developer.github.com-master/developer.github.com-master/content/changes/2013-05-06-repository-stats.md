Today we're happy to open our [Repository Statistics API](/v3/repos/statistics) to everyone.  We're using
repository statistics to power [our graphs](https://github.com/github/linguist/graphs),
but we can't wait to see what others can do with this information.

Starting today, these resources are available to you:

* **[Contributors](/v3/repos/statistics/#get-contributors-list-with-additions-deletions-and-commit-counts)**
* **[Commit Activity](/v3/repos/statistics/#get-the-last-year-of-commit-activity-data)**
* **[Code Frequency](/v3/repos/statistics/#get-the-number-of-additions-and-deletions-per-week)**
* **[Participation](/v3/repos/statistics/#get-the-weekly-commit-count-for-the-repo-owner-and-everyone-else)**
* **[Punch Card](/v3/repos/statistics/#get-the-number-of-commits-per-hour-in-each-day)**

Enjoy!
