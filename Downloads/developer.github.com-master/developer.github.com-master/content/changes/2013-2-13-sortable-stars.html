As we [announced on the GitHub blog][post], Stars now support sorting. The
Repository Starring API now supports [two new parameters][params] when listing
Stars: `sort` and `direction`.

<pre class='terminal'>
curl https://api.github.com/users/defunkt/starred?sort=created&direction=asc
</pre>

Enjoy.
