# Hooks

* TOC
{:toc}

The Repository Hooks API allows repository admins to manage the post-receive 
hooks for a repository.  Hooks can be managed using the [JSON HTTP API](#json-http)
and the [PubSubHubbub API](#pubsubhubbub).

Each hook can be configured for a specific [service](#services) and one or 
more [events](#events), regardless of the API used to do so.

## Services

A service is basically the name used to refer to a hook that has configuration
settings, a list of available events, and default events.

> For instance, the 
[email](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/email.rb)
service is a built-in GitHub service that will send event [payloads](#payloads) 
to, at most, two email addresses.  It will trigger for the `push` 
event by default and supports the `public` event type as well.

A number of services have been integrated through the open source
[github-services](https://github.com/github/github-services) project.  When 
creating a [hook](#create-a-hook), the `:name` parameter must refer to one of 
these services.  A generic 
[Web](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/web.rb) 
service is available that can configured to trigger for any of the available 
[events](#events).

Documentation for all available service hooks can be found in the
[docs directory](https://github.com/github/github-services/tree/master/docs)
of the github-services repository.  A JSON representation of their names,
default events, supported events, and configuration options can be seen 
at [api.github.com/hooks](https://api.github.com/hooks).


## Events 

Active hooks can be configured to trigger for one or more service supported 
events. In other words, the service must support listening for the event you 
want to trigger.

For example, the 
[Web](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/web.rb)
service listens for all events, while the
[IRC](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/irc.rb)
service can only listen for `push`, `issues`, and `pull_request` events.

The available events are:

Name | Description
-----|-----------|
`push` | Any git push to a Repository. **This is the default event.**
`issues` | Any time an Issue is opened or closed.
`issue_comment` | Any time an Issue is commented on.
`commit_comment` | Any time a Commit is commented on.
`create` | Any time a Repository, Branch, or Tag is created.
`delete` | Any time a Branch or Tag is deleted.
`pull_request` | Any time a Pull Request is opened, closed, or synchronized (updated due to a new push in the branch that the pull request is tracking).
`pull_request_review_comment` | Any time a Commit is commented on while inside a Pull Request review (the Files Changed tab).
`gollum` | Any time a Wiki page is updated.
`watch` | Any time a User watches the Repository.
`release` | Any time a Release is published in the Repository.
`fork` | Any time a Repository is forked.
`member` | Any time a User is added as a collaborator to a non-Organization Repository.
`public` | Any time a Repository changes from private to public.
`team_add` | Any time a team is added or modified on a Repository.
`status` | Any time a Repository has a status update from the API
`deployment` | Any time a Repository has a new deployment created from the API.
`deployment_status` | Any time a deployment for the Repository has a status update from the API.


### Payloads

The payloads for all hooks mirror [the payloads for the Event
types](/v3/activity/events/types/), with the exception of [the original `push`
event](http://help.github.com/post-receive-hooks/), 
which has a more detailed payload.


## JSON HTTP

The JSON HTTP API follows the same conventions as the rest of the 
[GitHub API](http://developer.github.com/v3/).

### List

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks

#### Response

<%= headers 200, :pagination => default_pagination_rels %>
<%= json(:hook) { |h| [h] } %>

### Get single hook

    GET /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id

#### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :hook %>

### Create a hook

    POST /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks

#### Parameter

Name | Type | Description 
-----|------|--------------
`name`|`string` | **Required**. The name of the service that is being called. (See [/hooks](https://api.github.com/hooks) for the list of valid hook names.)
`config`|`hash` | **Required**. Key/value pairs to provide settings for this hook.  These settings vary between the services and are defined in the [github-services](https://github.com/github/github-services) repository. Booleans are stored internally as "1" for true, and "0" for false.  Any JSON `true`/`false` values will be converted automatically.
`events`|`array` | Determines what events the hook is triggered for.  Default: `["push"]`
`active`|`boolean` | Determines whether the hook is actually triggered on pushes.

##### Example

The ["web" service hook](https://github.com/github/github-services/blob/master/lib/services/web.rb#L4-11)
takes these fields in the `config`:

Name | Type | Description 
-----|------|--------------
`url`|`string` | **Required**. The URL to which the payloads will be delivered.
`content_type`|`string` | The media type used to serialize the payloads. Supported values: `json` and `form`. Default: `form`.
`secret`|`string` | If defined, then HTTP requests that deliver the payloads will include an `X-Hub-Signature` header. The value of this header is computed as the [HMAC hex digest of the body, using the `secret` as the key][hub-signature].
`insecure_ssl`|`string` | Determines whether the SSL certificate of the host for `url` will be verified when delivering payloads. Supported values: `"0"` (verification is performed) and `"1"` (verification is not performed). Default: `"0"`.

Here's how you can setup a hook that posts payloads in JSON format:

<%= json \
      :name => "web",
      :active => true,
      :events => ['push', 'pull_request'],
      :config => {
        :url => 'http://example.com/webhook',
        :content_type => 'json'}
%>

#### Response

<%= headers 201,
      :Location => 'https://api.github.com/repos/user/repo/hooks/1' %>
<%= json :hook %>

### Edit a hook

    PATCH /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id

#### Parameter

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|--------------
`config`|`hash` | Key/value pairs to provide settings for this hook.  Modifying this will replace the entire config object.  These settings vary between the services and are defined in the [github-services](https://github.com/github/github-services) repository. Booleans are stored internally as "1" for true, and "0" for false.  Any JSON `true`/`false` values will be converted automatically.
`events`|`array` | Determines what events the hook is triggered for.  This replaces the entire array of events.  Default: `["push"]`
`add_events`|`array` | Determines a list of events to be added to the list of events that the Hook triggers for.
`remove_events`|`array` | Determines a list of events to be removed from the list of events that the Hook triggers for.
`active`|`boolean` | Determines whether the hook is actually triggered on pushes.


##### Example

<%= json \
      :active => true,
      :add_events => ['pull_request']
%>

#### Response

<%= headers 200 %>
<%= json :hook %>

### Test a `push` hook

This will trigger the hook with the latest push to the current
repository if the hook is subscribed to `push` events. If the
hook is not subscribed to `push` events, the server will respond
with 204 but no test POST will be generated.

    POST /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id/tests

**Note**: Previously `/repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id/test`

#### Response

<%= headers 204 %>

## Delete a hook

    DELETE /repos/:owner/:repo/hooks/:id

#### Response

<%= headers 204 %>

## PubSubHubbub

GitHub can also serve as a [PubSubHubbub][pubsub] hub for all repositories.
PSHB is a simple publish/subscribe protocol
that lets servers register to receive updates when a topic is updated.
The updates are sent with an HTTP POST request to a callback URL.
Topic URLs for a GitHub repository's pushes are in this format:

    https://github.com/:owner/:repo/events/:event

The event can be any [event](#events) string that is listed at the top of this
document.

### Response format

The default format is what [existing post-receive hooks should
expect][post-receive]: A JSON body sent as the `payload` parameter in a
POST.  You can also specify to receive the raw JSON body with either an
`Accept` header, or a `.json` extension.

    Accept: application/json
    https://github.com/:owner/:repo/events/push.json

### Callback URLs

Callback URLs can use either the `http://` protocol, or `github://`.
`github://` callbacks specify a GitHub service.

    # Send updates to postbin.org
    http://postbin.org/123

    # Send updates to Campfire
    github://campfire?subdomain=github&room=Commits&token=abc123

### Subscribing

The GitHub PubSubHubbub endpoint is: https://api.github.com/hub.
(GitHub Enterprise users should use http://yourhost/api/v3/hub as the
PubSubHubbub endpoint, but not change the `hub.topic` URI format.) A
successful request with curl looks like:

    curl -u "user" -i \
      https://api.github.com/hub \
      -F "hub.mode=subscribe" \
      -F "hub.topic=https://github.com/:owner/:repo/events/push" \
      -F "hub.callback=http://postbin.org/123"

PubSubHubbub requests can be sent multiple times.  If the hook already
exists, it will be modified according to the request.

#### Parameters

Name | Type | Description 
-----|------|--------------
``hub.mode``|`string` | **Required**. Either `subscribe` or `unsubscribe`.
``hub.topic``|`string` |**Required**.  The URI of the GitHub repository to subscribe to.  The path must be in the format of `/:owner/:repo/events/:event`.
``hub.callback``|`string` | The URI to receive the updates to the topic.
``hub.secret``|`string` | A shared secret key that generates a SHA1 HMAC of the outgoing body content.  You can verify a push came from GitHub by comparing the raw request body with the contents of the `X-Hub-Signature` header.  You can see [our Ruby implementation][ruby-secret], or [the PubSubHubbub documentation][pshb-secret] for more details.
