the Google BigQuery API with Java.

About
=====
This code is a simple demonstration of how to get started with incorporating the 
BigQuery Service API in your own Java-based applications, using the
Google Java API Client Libraries.

The sample code in this article demonstrates how to run a query on one of
BigQuery's publicly available datasets, so that you can get started on your
application without needing to upload any data of your own.

This code is unsupported.

Prerequisites
=============
At minimum, your project will need to access the classes contained in these
files:

1. The core Google API Java client library .jar files
http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/downloads/list

2. The Generated Java Client .jar files for the BigQuery API
http://code.google.com/p/google-api-java-client/wiki/APIs#BigQuery_API

The core Google Java client library includes classes for JSON manipulation and
HTTP requests, along with classes to help with OAuth 2.0 authorization and
token management. The generated BigQuery Java client provides classes specific
to the BigQuery API.
